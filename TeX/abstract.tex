		This thesis focuses on enhancing the \textit{process comprehension} of an Industrial Control System (ICS) by employing a dynamic black-box analysis approach to analyze the system's physical process. The proposed analysis methodology involves multiple steps and utilizes a custom tool capable of extracting valuable insights about the behavior of the industrial system from both physical process logs and network traffic logs. The tool and methodology will be validated through a case study based on a real-world scenario.\newline
		The ultimate goal of this analysis is to gain a deep understanding of the industrial system under examination, with the aim of uncovering as much knowledge as possible. By comprehensively studying the system's behavior and characteristics, potential attackers can develop targeted and covert attack strategies.
